The Big Idea (Problem): Different state agencies might be buying the same type of thing (like office supplies, IT services, or even furniture) from different vendors at different prices. This means the state could be missing out on big discounts if they bought in bulk! What Your Team Will Do (AI/FinTech Application): You'll use AI to identify where different state departments are spending money on similar items or services, but perhaps from different vendors or at different costs. It's like finding "buy one, get one free" opportunities the state didn't even know it had.
