This project challenges participants to develop a predictive model that estimates the total revenue a student-run business will generate—based on transaction patterns from previous stores and the profile of the school’s surrounding community. Using anonymized past transaction data from Venderly-powered stores (processed via Stripe and Square), students will explore how factors like school size, business category, and urban vs. rural location influence sales outcomes. By combining time-based sales signals with demographic and contextual school data, participants will build machine learning models that forecast revenue and generate personalized business recommendations for future student entrepreneurs. This project not only empowers data-driven entrepreneurship education but also offers a pathway to scalable, community-aware innovation in youth business development.
