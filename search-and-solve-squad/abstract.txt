Employee helper. Today we leverage Atlassian JIRA service management for employees to submit tickets when they need various forms of help (software access, hardware inssues, HR questions, production system issues, etc) and we have repetitive feedback that it's hard to find the right ticket to open and I was thinking about an AI solution that would be where all employees go to ask for help and then its trained on where the help is, and helps the employee navigate quickly to the right ticket form and or area to solve their need
